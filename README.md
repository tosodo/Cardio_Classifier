Predicting (CVD) Using Machine Learning(ML).


Using classification models , I was able to establish a good method to predict cardiovascular disease(CVD). 

One in four deaths in Britain is caused by CVD and has a very high human and Economic cost.A process that can save clinical diagnosis and research would not only save money but also lifes .

Figures released by the Centre for Economic and Business Research shows the total cost of CVD in the UK is set to rise by over £3billion in the next six years, from around £15billion in 2014 to over £18billion in 2020.

I used dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset .
I used mainly information from several sources with facts and figures from 
https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/our-research/heart-statistics/heart-statistics-publications/cardiovascular-disease-statistics-2019.

 Executive Summary

7 Million people have a (CVD)condition in the the entire country and plenty of resources used to manage and treat (CVD). Early intervention and prediction can add value to person(s) at risk of (CVD).Saving the tax payer,Lives and the economy interms of productivity .
These two sentences will demonstrate your business understanding. 

Applying Machine learning Models by analysing data using different classifier methods to predict the risk of (CVD) i found an accuracy prediction of 73% in my best Machine Learning Model .

The process of prediction would be automated to help the clinicians and reseachers use it without much effort,saving time in clinical hours .

The data was categorical,to get good results I used One Hot Encoding, machine learning algorithms cannot work with categorical data directly. The categories must be converted into numbers.
I split my data into Train and test Split .

Analyze and perform EDA on the Dataset
Applying knowledge of CRISP-DM methodology.


I used data from kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset] 

I used several machine learning models to analysis namely :

Then end with one sentence that picks what your best model was and how it performed.

The scientific community in the recent years have been adopting machine learning in research and clinical work .Machine learning is still developing and will improve with the advancement in technology. It is important to adopt machine learning to improve the process and lives .

The aim of the project is to help advance the predictive process of cvd .The model pediction matrix show a good accuracy score with 73% accuracy .

The goal of this project was to create a classification model that was able to predict cardiovascular diseases.


 1. 1 in 4 deaths in the UK is Cardiovascular related,using modern machine learning techniques can improve the chances of early prediction .
 2. Automating the diagnostic process will save clinical time and save lives . This will also reduce the number of misdiagnosed cases , which account for 1 in 3 cases .
 
 
> 3. You show off your analystical and modeling chops.
4. I used a classification models to predict the cardiovascular disease as it was categorical data ,using classifiers would give me good results in my models .

### More Information
Machine learning in a cvd context is digital diagnosis. ML can detect patterns of cvd within patient electronic healthcare records and inform clinicians of any anomalies .

Here I would especially suggest diving a bit deeper into your methodology and including images that you are proud of from the project. 
Remember, that people will probably judge your github project page within 45 seconds tops, you want it to look as clean as possible. 

Write documentation that looks like someone you would want to work with.
