# Predicting (CVD) Using Machine Learning(ML).


Using classification models , I was able to establish the best method to predict cardiovascular disease(CVD). 

One in four deaths in Britain is caused by CVD and has a very high human and Economic cost.A process that can save clinical diagnosis and research would not only save money but also lifes .

Figures released by the Centre for Economic and Business Research shows the total cost of CVD in the UK is set to rise by over £3billion in the next six years, from around £15billion in 2014 to over £18billion in 2020.

I used dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset .
I used mainly information from several sources with facts and figures from 
https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/our-research/heart-statistics/heart-statistics-publications/cardiovascular-disease-statistics-2019.

> We suggest that people follow a "Facebook Page" approach to writing up their README. This means that the most important information is at the top (your name, point of project, contact info) and then as you go down the document you get less and less relevant information. Remember that you are NOT writing a detective story and need to find a way to present as much information as quickly as possible to the person that will be looking at this for 45 seconds tops. Of course others might look for longer, but the UX/UI of your REAMDE should be done with the 'github skimmer' in mind.

### Executive Summary

7 Million people have a (CVD)condition in the the entire country and plenty of resources used to manage and treat (CVD). Early intervention and prediction can add value to person(s) at risk of (CVD).Saving the tax payer,Lives and the economy interms of productivity .
These two sentences will demonstrate your business understanding. 

Applying Machine learning Models by analysing data using different classifier methods to predict the risk of (CVD) i found an accuracy prediction of 73% in my best Machine Learning Model .

The process of prediction would be automated to help the clinicians and reseachers use it without much effort,saving time in clinical hours .

The data was categorical,to get good results I used One Hot Encoding, machine learning algorithms cannot work with categorical data directly. The categories must be converted into numbers.
I split my data into Train and test Split .

Analyze and perform EDA on the Dataset
Applying knowledge of CRISP-DM methodology.


I used data from kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset] 

I used several machine learning models to analysis namely :

Then end with one sentence that picks what your best model was and how it performed.

Lastly, you say in one or two sentences why this matters. 
For example, now as opposed to before this data analysis, you can now predict X better than Y. 

The goal of this project was to create a `regression/classification` model that was able to predict `what you set out to do`.

> If you are able to swap out the text here with what your case example is you will demonstrate the following:
> 1. You get why what you're doing 'matters'
> 2. You are able to take ill defined problems and turn them into something a data scienst can solve
> 3. You show off your analystical and modeling chops.
> 4. You are able to communicate technical things you do.

### More Information

Below your Executive Summary, you can document whatever you feel would be of interest to a future employer.
Here I would especially suggest diving a bit deeper into your methodology and including images that you are proud of from the project. 
Remember, that people will probably judge your github project page within 45 seconds tops, you want it to look as clean as possible. 

Write documentation that looks like someone you would want to work with.
